        "tone": "Tragic Noir. Gritty, rain-soaked, and emotionally heavy.",

        "projectHeirloom": "A Bio-Dyne breeding program from 30 years ago. Goal: Create humans with durable organs for labor. Result: Subjects have above-average organ strength and longevity, but Bio-Dyne engineered two failsafes.",
        "typeH": "All Heirloom subjects have 'Type-H' blood - an artificial blood type incompatible with normal transfusions. They can only receive organs from other Type-H donors.",
        "geneticTimebomb": "Bio-Dyne engineered a genetic killswitch. Without a suppressant compound in the water supply, subjects begin terminal organ failure after ~10 years. The water treatment stopped 15 years ago when Bio-Dyne abandoned the project.",
        "theGasLeak": "The official story: An industrial accident 15 years ago. The truth: Bio-Dyne used nerve gas to liquidate the subjects before selling the land to Omni-Global. But some survived.",
        "theMystery": "All surviving Heirloom subjects are now falling ill simultaneously - regardless of age, gender, or lifestyle. The genetic timebomb has gone off. There is no cure. No hospital can help them.",
        "elenaHistory": "Elena (Subject 01) was the Control Subject - kept pristine while others were tested. When the liquidation order came, she was in a biocell awaiting experimental treatment. The raiders cleared the building but missed her room - the entrance was concealed behind a maintenance panel. She has been in stasis for 15 years, frozen mid-treatment, waiting for a cure that never came.",
        "theStingInTheTail": "Even if Jax receives Elena's heart, the genetic timebomb is not cured. Her organs will slow his decline, but the killswitch is in his DNA. All Elena's sacrifice buys him is time. Months. Maybe a year. The tragedy is complete.",
        "jaxHistory": "Jax was born 'Subject 89'. At age 15, he traded the ventilation codes to the mercs for his freedom, unknowingly helping them gas his own neighborhood. Now the timebomb is killing him.",
        "theHazers": "Survivors of the gas living in the ruin. They are all dying from the same genetic timebomb. They protect the zone as a tomb - and soon, their own.",
        "theGhost": "Elena is not a supernatural ghost. She is a glitched user profile. Her neural link has been active for 15 years, creating a directory of 'dreams' in the local system.",
        "theMark": "The Lattice. A faint honeycomb pattern in the eyes of all subjects. Establish this early with Jax, then reveal it on the Hazers.",
        "theBetrayal": "Jax didn't know about the gas. He thought he was helping an eviction. The proof is on the keycard he carries."
