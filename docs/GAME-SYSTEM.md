# NEON PROTOCOL — Game System Reference

> *"In the sprawl, your chrome is your resume and your wetware is your edge."*

---

## 1. Overview

**Neon Protocol** is a streamlined tabletop RPG system designed for cyberpunk narratives. It emphasizes fast resolution, player agency, and the tension between humanity and technology.

### 1.1 Core Philosophy

- **Fiction First** — Describe what you do, then roll if there's risk
- **Fail Forward** — Failed rolls create complications, not dead ends
- **Chrome Has Cost** — Every augmentation trades humanity for capability
- **The Edge Matters** — Preparation and positioning beat raw stats

### 1.2 Dice System

All checks use **d20 + Attribute + Skill** vs a **Difficulty Class (DC)**.

| DC | Difficulty | Example |
|----|------------|---------|
| 8 | Routine | Hacking an unprotected terminal |
| 12 | Standard | Picking a commercial lock |
| 15 | Challenging | Convincing a suspicious guard |
| 18 | Hard | Cracking military-grade ICE |
| 22 | Extreme | Infiltrating a megacorp black site |
| 25+ | Legendary | Rewriting your own neural firmware |

**Critical Success (Natural 20):** Exceptional outcome + bonus effect  
**Critical Failure (Natural 1):** Complication even if total beats DC

---

## 2. Attributes

Six core attributes define a character's baseline capabilities. Range: **-1 to +3** (human average is +0).

> **Design Note:** Keeping bonuses tight means the d20 (chaos) matters more than the stat (the hero). This creates the noir feeling of being out of control.

| Attribute | Abbr | Governs |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **REFLEX** | REF | Speed, agility, reaction time, ranged combat |
| **BODY** | BOD | Strength, endurance, melee combat, resilience |
| **TECH** | TEC | Engineering, repair, crafting, cyberware |
| **NEURAL** | NEU | Hacking, AI interaction, mental fortitude |
| **EDGE** | EDG | Perception, intuition, luck, street smarts |
| **PRESENCE** | PRE | Charisma, intimidation, negotiation, performance |

---

## 3. Skills

Skills represent trained competencies. Range: **0 to +5**.

### 3.1 Combat Skills
| Skill | Attribute | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Firearms** | REF | Pistols, rifles, SMGs |
| **Heavy Weapons** | REF | Rockets, mounted guns, explosives |
| **Melee** | BOD | Blades, clubs, martial arts |
| **Evasion** | REF | Dodging, taking cover |

---

## 4. Derived Stats

### 4.1 Stress Track (The Shield)

Stress represents near-misses, luck, and scrambling for cover. It resets when the **scene ends**.

- **Default:** PCs have **5 Stress boxes**. NPCs have 1–3 based on threat level.
- When you take harm, mark **1 Stress box** per "hit" the GM calls for.
- When you can't mark Stress (no empty boxes), you take a **Wound** instead.

### 4.2 Wounds (The Meat)

Wounds are real injuries. They persist until treated in-fiction.

Track **three Wound slots**:

| Slot | Severity | Penalty | Example |
|------|----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Minor | -1 to relevant checks | "Grazed Shoulder" |
| 2 | Major | -2 to relevant checks | "Broken Ribs" |
| 3 | Critical | **Out of the scene** | "Gut Shot" |

- Each time you would take a Wound, fill the next empty slot and name it.
- Penalties stack.
- **Critical** means you're down — not necessarily dead, but you can't keep fighting.

**Healing Wounds:**
- Field patch → downgrade Major to Minor
- Hospital/surgery → clear a Wound slot
- Critical almost always requires outside help

### 4.3 Armor

Armor provides **flat damage reduction** — it absorbs harm before it becomes Stress or Wounds.

| Armor Type | Rating | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Street Clothes | 0 | No protection |
| Armored Jacket | 1 | Concealable |
| Tactical Vest | 2 | Standard security |
| Combat Armor | 3 | Military grade |
| Powered Exo | 4 | Requires training |

When you take harm, reduce severity by your Armor Rating at GM's discretion.

### 4.4 Initiative (Simplified)

At the **start** of a violent moment:

1. Everyone rolls **d20 + REF** (Reflex Check)
2. Highest acts first, then opposition, then others as needed
3. After the opening exchange, fall back to **Spotlight flow** (see Combat)

---

## 5. Cyberware & Glitches

Augmentations grant power at the cost of your humanity — but not as a number. Each major piece of chrome adds a **Glitch**: a narrative complication that defines how the tech changes you.

### 5.1 Cyberware Categories

| Category | Slot | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Neuralware** | Head | Brain implants, interfaces, co-processors |
| **Optics** | Eyes | Vision enhancements, targeting, recording |
| **Bodyware** | Torso | Internal organs, subdermal armor, biomonitors |
| **Cyberarm** | Arm | Replacement limbs, built-in weapons |
| **Cyberleg** | Leg | Replacement limbs, jump boosters |
| **Chipware** | Slot | Skillsofts, memory chips, reflex boosters |

### 5.2 Glitches (Replacing Humanity Points)

Instead of tracking a numeric "Humanity" pool, every **major** cyberware piece adds a **Glitch Aspect** — a narrative flag that complicates your life.

| Cyberware | Example Glitch |
|-----------|----------------|
| Cyber-Heart | "Requires specialized meds or I flatline" |
| Militech Eyes | "I see heat signatures, not faces" |
| Reflex Booster | "Twitchy — I flinch at sudden movements" |
| Cyberarm | "Phantom pain when it rains" |
| Neural Link | "Sometimes I hear the Net whisper" |

**Using Glitches:**
- The GM can **compel** a Glitch: lean into the complication for spotlight and trouble
- The player can **invoke** a Glitch: use it creatively for advantage in appropriate situations
- Glitches are roleplay prompts, not a "Game Over" counter

### 5.3 Example Cyberware

```json
{
    "id": "neural_link_mk2",
    "name": "Neural Link Mk.II",
    "category": "neuralware",
    "slot": "head",
    "glitch": "Sometimes I hear the Net whisper",
    "description": "Direct neural interface for device control and netrunning.",
    "effects": [
        { "type": "skill_bonus", "skill": "Netrunning", "value": 1 },
        { "type": "ability", "name": "Jack In", "description": "Connect directly to compatible systems" }
    ],
    "cost": 5000,
    "availability": "common"
}
```

---

## 6. Combat

### 6.1 Spotlight Flow (Replacing Action Economy)

Throw out Action/Move/Reaction. Use **Spotlight** instead:

1. **Spotlight on Player:** The camera is on you. Say what you do.
2. **GM Responds:** Consequences, rolls, new threats.
3. **World Reacts:** When you pause, hesitate, or the fiction demands it — enemies shoot, clocks advance, alarms escalate.

Treat combat like a tense conversation, not a wargame. If the player freezes, the enemy acts.

### 6.2 Attack Resolution

```
Attack Roll: d20 + REF + Firearms (or relevant skill)
vs
Defense: 10 + Target's REF + Evasion (or cover bonus)
```

**Hit:** Target marks Stress (or takes a Wound if Stress is full). Armor reduces severity.  
**Miss:** No effect (or graze for style).

**Harm Severity (GM guidance):**
| Weapon | Typical Harm |
|--------|-------------|
| Fists, improvised | 1 Stress |
| Knife, pistol | 1–2 Stress |
| SMG, rifle | 2 Stress (or Wound if unarmored) |
| Heavy weapon | Wound directly |

### 6.3 Damage Types

| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Kinetic** | Standard bullets, blades — reduced by armor |
| **Energy** | Lasers, plasma — ignores half armor |
| **EMP** | Disables cyberware, no Stress damage |
| **Bio** | Toxins, viruses — ignores armor, resisted by BOD |

### 6.4 Cover

| Cover | Defense Bonus |
|-------|---------------|
| Light (furniture) | +2 |
| Heavy (walls, vehicles) | +4 |
| Full (only exposed to attack) | +6 |

---

## 7. Netrunning (The Diegetic Shift)

In *A Change of Heart*, the player uses a **real terminal interface**. If they type the correct command or solve the puzzle, **the hack works** — no roll required for success.

Rolls determine **Time and Detection**, not success.

### 7.1 The Principle

> **Player:** "I run the decryption script." *(actually types it)*  
> **GM:** "Okay, you're running it. Roll Neural. On a success, it runs instantly. On a fail, it takes 30 seconds and the Hazers are banging on the door."

This harmonizes "The Work" (the app) with "The Tension" (the dice).

### 7.2 Net Actions — Time & Heat

| Action | Heat DC | On Fail |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Scan** | 10 | Takes extra time, system logs the probe |
| **Crack** | 12 | Slow decrypt, ICE may activate |
| **Control** | 12 | Delayed response, security alerted |
| **Extract** | 15 | Partial data, trace initiated |
| **Crash** | 15 | System reboots but alerts backup |
| **Mask** | 12 | Presence hidden, but not for long |

**On Success:** Fast, clean, minimal trace.  
**On Fail:** It still works, but costs time or raises heat.

### 7.3 ICE Types

| ICE | Rating | Effect if Triggered |
|-----|--------|---------------------|
| **Watchdog** | 12 | Alerts security |
| **Barrier** | 15 | Blocks access until cracked |
| **Tracer** | 15 | Reveals runner's location |
| **Black ICE** | 18+ | Neural feedback — take a Wound |
